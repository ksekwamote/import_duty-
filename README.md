# Duties

Swiss Online Import Costs Calculator.

**Online Version: [https://duties.ch/](https://duties.ch/)**

## Introduction

Ordering things online in Switzerland can result in unexpected fees. This
project tries to shed some light on how this works and what fees you can expect.

Note that the fees calculated here may differ from the actual fee. It's a
complicated matter and I do not work in customs, so my understanding might be
off.

Umport regulation changes all the time and your supplier as well as the
customs office make mistakes. There are also many corner cases which this
tool does not address. I trust that if you're importing diamonds by the
buckets that you'll know better than to consult this online tool.

**Therefore, results obtained through this calculator are offered without guarantee.**

## Issues

Please let me know if you find anything wrong with this tool. Ideally you either
have legislature backing up your discovery, or the actual bill you got for
importing something.
